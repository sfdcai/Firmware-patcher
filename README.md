# XMiR-Patcher

XMiR-Patcher is a cross-platform toolkit that streamlines preparing and patching
Xiaomi router firmware. It bundles device unlock helpers, backup utilities, and
an automated build workflow for crafting custom ImmortalWrt images without
touching device bootloaders.

---

## Key features

* **Menu-driven launcher** â€“ `run.sh`/`run.bat` provide a unified interface for
  every supported action, including device information, language packs, and the
  build manager.
* **Safety-first build automation** â€“ `build_manager.py` orchestrates the full
  Redmi AX5400 (RA74) ImmortalWrt workflow with dry-run toggles, colorised
  logging, and resumable stages.
* **Comprehensive backups** â€“ streamed SSH dumps of critical NAND partitions and
  checksum generation help you maintain reliable fallbacks.
* **Vendor blob integration** â€“ pulls Qualcomm Wi-Fi/NSS firmware directly from
  the router and injects the assets into the ImmortalWrt `files/` overlay.

---

## Requirements

* Python **3.8+**
* `openssl` (for crypto helpers)
* Typical build utilities (installed automatically by the build workflow when
  run on Ubuntu/Debian): `build-essential`, `gawk`, `git`, `gettext`,
  `libncurses5-dev`, `libssl-dev`, `xsltproc`, `zlib1g-dev`, `unzip`,
  `python3`, `rsync`.

---

## Getting started

### Windows

1. Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed and available in `PATH`.
2. Double-click `run.bat` and follow the on-screen menu.

### Linux / macOS

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

The launcher will set up a virtual environment (if required) and expose the
same menu-driven interface as the Windows entrypoint.

---

## Build manager quick start

1. Launch the main menu (`run.sh` or `run.bat`).
2. Navigate to **Other functions â†’ Launch build workflow manager**.
3. Configure environment overrides as needed (e.g.
   `export BUILD_ROUTER_HOST=192.168.1.190`).
4. Work through the numbered stages:
   * **Preflight** â€“ verifies required binaries and workspace layout.
   * **Backups** â€“ streams NAND partitions and generates checksums so you have a
     proven recovery path.
   * **Vendor assets** â€“ syncs Wi-Fi/NSS blobs from the router into your
     workspace.
   * **Repository sync** â€“ clones or updates ImmortalWrt, updates feeds, and
     applies the RA74 DTS/Makefile patches.
   * **Overlay preparation** â€“ copies fetched blobs, writes first-boot scripts,
     and makes them executable.
   * **Build** â€“ launches `make menuconfig` followed by a parallel
     `make -j$(nproc)` compile.
   * **Artifact verification** â€“ locates the newest `*ra74*sysupgrade*.bin` and
     records its SHA256 hash.

All stages honour the global `DRY_RUN=true` environment variable so you can
exercise the workflow without executing external commands.

---

## Best practices

* **Review generated files** â€“ confirm DTS/Makefile updates and overlay content
  before flashing anything to hardware.
* **Validate checksums** â€“ always compare the recorded SHA256 hash with the
  artifact you plan to transfer.
* **Keep fallbacks handy** â€“ store stock firmware and your NAND dumps on a
  separate machine to simplify recovery.
